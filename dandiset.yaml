description: "Neuropixels Ultra Probe Imposed Motion Dataset provides a dataset, where
  neural activity was recorded with Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra) in awake mouse visual
  cortex.  NP Ultra probe measures neural activity at ultra-high density, with 6-micron
  center-to-center spacing between sites, in 8x48 site configuration (total width
  x length: 48 x 288 micron). \n\nProbe up-down motion was artificially imposed in
  the brain tissue during brain recording. A total of 10 steps forward and 9 alternating
  steps\nbackwards were imposed for each session, with 25 μm travel in each direction
  at 1 μm/sec speed. This results in 25 micron net displacement by the end of the
  imposed motion.\n\n118 natural images were presented at random times with repetition
  before and after imposed motion, for \"fingerprinting\" the identities of the visual
  cortical neurons with their unique visual responses.\n\nThis dataset provides an
  opportunity for designing and testing spike sorting algorithms, with neural activity
  sampled at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.(1) Manually imposed motion
  and (2)neural identification with visual responses pre- and post- motion provide
  ground truth reference for testing the accuracy of motion correction and spike sorting."
