description: "Neuropixels Ultra Probe Imposed Motion Dataset provides a dataset, where
  Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra) probe motion was artificially imposed during brain
  recording in awake mice.\nNP Ultra probe measures neural activity at ultra-high
  density, with 6-micron center-to-center spacing between sites, in 8x48 configuration.
  \nThis dataset provides an opportunity for designing a motion correction algorithm
  with neural activity sampled at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.  "
